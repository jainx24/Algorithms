/* Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from  to  for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet .

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing  with ,  with , and  with .

If ai>bi, then Alice is awarded  point.
If ai<bi, then Bob is awarded  point.
If ai=bi, then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given  and , can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?

Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers, , , and , describing the respective values in triplet . 
The second line contains  space-separated integers, , , and , describing the respective values in triplet .

Constraints

Output Format

Print two space-separated integers denoting the respective comparison points earned by Alice and Bob. */
